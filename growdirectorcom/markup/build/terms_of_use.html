              this Terms of Use, (3) respond to claims that any such data
              violates the rights of others, or (4) protect the rights, property
              or personal safety of GrowDirector, its employees, users of or
              visitors to the Platform, and the public. <br />
              You agree that GrowDirector may, in its sole discretion and
              without prior notice, terminate your access to the Device and the
              Platform and/or block your future access to the Platform if we
              determine that you have violated this Terms of Use or other
              agreements or guidelines which may be associated with your use of
              the Device or the Platform. You also agree that any violation by
              you of this Terms of Use will constitute an unlawful and unfair
              business practice, and will cause irreparable harm to
              GrowDirector, for which monetary damages would be inadequate, and
              you consent to GrowDirector obtaining any injunctive or equitable
              relief that GrowDirector deems necessary or appropriate in such
              circumstances. These remedies are in addition to any other
              remedies GrowDirector may have at law or in equity. <br />
              You agree that GrowDirector may, in its sole discretion and
              without prior notice, terminate your access to the Platform, for
              cause, which includes (but is not limited to) (1) requests by law
              enforcement or other government agencies, (2) a request by you
              (self-initiated account deletions), (3) discontinuance or material
              modification of the Device, the Platform or any Service offered on
              or through the Platform, or (4) unexpected technical issues or
              problems. <br />
              If GrowDirector does take any legal action against you as a result
              of your violation of this Terms of Use, GrowDirector will be
              entitled to recover from you, and you agree to pay, all reasonable
              attorneys’ fees and costs of such action, in addition to any other
              relief granted to GrowDirector. You agree that GrowDirector will
              not be liable to you or to any third party for termination of your
              access to the Platform as a result of any violation of this Terms
              of Use.
            </p>
            <h3>Indemnity</h3>
            <p>

              directors, shareholders, predecessors, successors in interest,
              employees, agents, subsidiaries and affiliates, harmless from any
              demands, loss, liability, claims or expenses (including attorneys’

            <h3>Governing Law</h3>
            <p>
              This Terms of Use and the Privacy Policy shall be solely governed
              by the Laws of the State of Israel, and any dispute arising from,
              or in relation with this Terms of Use, shall be subject to the
              exclusive jurisdiction of the competent courts of Tel-Aviv, and
              each of the parties hereby irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction
              of such jurisdiction.
            </p>
            <h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
            <p>
              You may not use or export or re-export any products, features,
              services or content, or any copy or adaptation of such, offered on
              the Platform or by the Device, in violation of any applicable laws
              or regulations, including without limitation United States export
              laws and regulations. If any of the provisions of this Terms of
              Use are held by a court or other tribunal of competent
              jurisdiction to be void or unenforceable, such provisions shall be
              limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary and replaced
              with a valid provision that best and most closely embodies the
              intent of this Terms of Use, so that this Terms of Use shall
              remain in full force and effect. This Terms of Use constitute the
              entire agreement between you and GrowDirector with regard to your
              use of the Device and the Platform, and any and all other written
              or oral agreements or understandings previously existing between
              you and GrowDirector with respect to such use are hereby
              superseded and cancelled. Other than as provided in a purchase or
              similar agreement you enter into with GrowDirector or any of
              GrowDirector authorized distributor, reseller or agent,
              GrowDirector will not accept any counter-offers to this Terms of
              Use, and all such offers are hereby categorically rejected.
              GrowDirector’s failure to insist on or enforce strict performance
              of this Terms of Use shall not be construed as a waiver by
              GrowDirector of any provision or any right it has to enforce thus
              Terms of Use, nor shall any course of conduct between GrowDirector
              and you or any other party be deemed to modify any provision of
              this Terms of Use. This Terms of Use shall not be interpreted or
              construed to confer any rights or remedies on any third parties.
